# Wordpress Plugin Starter

## Description

A boiler-plate for a WordPress plugin. WordPress Plugin Starter helps you create fully functioning WordPress plugins quickly and in a way that is easy to debug. It allows you create WordPress plugins in an object oriented pattern.

This project was inspired from **Mehdi Soltani**'s [oop-wordpress-plugin-boilerplate](<github.com/msn60/oop-wordpress-plugin-boilerplate>).

## Compatibility

**WordPress Plugin Starter** is compatible with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) version *5.6.5* to *6.0.2*, and [PHP](https://php.net) version *8.0* up.

## License

AGPL-3.0-or-later

## Documentation

Documentation is still being compiled.

## First Step

1. Download/Clone the project from the repository
2. Rename the root folder (**wordpress-plugin-starter**) to match your plugin. Example `awesome-plugin`
3. Open the main plugin file **wordpress-plugin-starter.php** and modify the **header fields** to match your plugin
4. Rename (**wordpress-plugin-starter.php**) to the name of your plugin (must be identical with the name of the parent folder). Example `awesome-plugin.php`
5. The **app** directory stores custom classes that you will use to add functionalities to your plugin

## Project Folders

### app

The app directory contains custom classes you will use to add functionalities to your plugin. This directory contains two sub directories: **Admin** and **Public**.

### assets

The assets directory contains your plugin asset files like css files, javascript files, image files, etc. It contains three (3) sub directories - **css**, **images**, and **js**.

### configs

The configs directory contains configuration files that you can either use to modify default settings, or use in setting up features required by your plugin. Files in this directory includes: **database.php**, **date.php**, **routes.php**, and **views.php**.

### languages

The **languages** directory contains your plugin's language translation files. Examples are your POT files, PO files, and MO files.

### logs

The logs directory contains log files generated by the boiler-plate.

### src

The src directory contains the boiler-plate core files.

### vendor

The vendor directory contains core packages required by the boiler-plate.

### views

The views directory contains files that will be included at specific places within your plugin. Files that are used to output contents for admin pages, shortcodes, etc are stored in this directory. This directory contains two sub folders: **admin** and **public**.

## The app Directory

The **Admin** directory stores classes that will register features for use in the admin area of the site. It contains 9 folders and 1 file:

- AdminNotices              - for storing classes that will print admin notifications.
- AjaxRequests              - for storing classes that will handle ajax requests at the admin area.
- DatabaseTables            - for storing classes that will create database tables.
- Menus                     - for storing classes that will create admin pages.
- NavMenuMetaboxes          - for storing classes that will create nav menu metaboxes.
- PostColumns               - for storing classes that will create post columns.
- PostMetaboxes             - for storing classes that will create metaboxes.
- Settings                  - for storing classes that will create setting sections and fields.
- TaxonomyFormFields        - for storing classes that will create setting fields for taxonomies.
- Hooks.php                 - for registering custom action and filter hooks that will run in the admin area only.

The **Public** directory stores classes that will register features for use in both the admin and front-end area of the site. It contains 4 folders:

- AjaxRequests      - for storing classes that will handle ajax requests at the front-end area.
- PostTypes         - for storing classes that will register custom post types.
- Shortcodes        - for storing classes that will register shortcodes.
- Taxonomies        - for storing classes that will register custom taxonomies.

Other files found in the app directory are:

- **Activator.php**     - for handling tasks that will run after plugin activation.
- **Bindings.php**      - for registering custom classes that will add functionalties to your plugin.
- **Constants.php**     - for defining custom constants.
- **Deactivator.php**   - for handling tasks that will run after plugin deactivation.
- **functions.php**     - for creating custom helper functions.
- **Hooks.php**         - for registering custom action and filter hooks.
- **Uninstaller.php**   - for handling tasks that will run after the plugin is deleted.

## Issue With Namespace Conflicts

Due to the nature of WordPress, it is very likely that there will be namespace conflicts between two WordPress plugins that are developed using this boiler-plate if they are installed on one website. That means problems can arise when two or more WordPress plugins on your site are using different versions of **WordPress Plugin Starter**.

To prevent namespace conflicts, ensure that namespaces for all the classes used in this project are prefixed to allow them have unique namespace. That means classes in **src** and **app** directory should have unique namespace that will not conflict with namespaces from other WordPress plugins developed using this boiler-plate.

## Manual Fix For Class Namespace Conflicts

Example: You can choose to prefix all namespaces with **Plugin_Name**. That means any existing classes or newly created classes that are in the **app** directory with a namespace of `WPS_Plugin\App;` will have their namespace prefixed to `Plugin_Name\WPS_Plugin\App`. Also, all classes in the **src** directory will have their namespaces modified from `Codestartechnologies\WordpressPluginStarter\...;` to `Plugin_Name\Codestartechnologies\WordpressPluginStarter\...;`.

Next, open **autoload.php** where you'll find `WPSAutoLoader` class. Set the value for `WPSAutoLoader::$prefix` to `Plugin_Name`.

Remember to update other places within the project where classes are called using their namespace. That means every instance of `use WPS_Plugin\App\...` and `use Codestartechnologies\WordpressPluginStarter\..` will be modified to `use Plugin_Name\WPS_Plugin\App\...` and `use Plugin_Name\Codestartechnologies\WordpressPluginStarter\..`. Same with all instances of `\Codestartechnologies\WordpressPluginStarter\...` and `\WPS_Plugin\App\...` should be modified to `\Plugin_Name\Codestartechnologies\WordpressPluginStarter\..` and `\Plugin_Name\WPS_Plugin\App\...`.

## Fix For Class Namespace Conflicts Via C.L.I

We are currently working on a feature that will enable developers automatically generate custom namespace prefix via the command line interface for all classes used in the project except classes in **vendor/** directory. This feature will take away the need for editing files manualy.
